## C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)

Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides the following features inside VS Code:

* Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
* Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
* Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono debugging is not supported. Desktop CLR debugging has [limited support](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Desktop-.NET-Framework).
* Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

## Using .NET 6 builds of OmniSharp

Starting with C# extension version 1.24.0, there is now an option to use build of OmniSharp that runs on the .NET 6 SDK. This build requires that the .NET 6 SDK be installed and does not use Visual Studio MSBuild tools or Mono. It only supports newer SDK-style projects that are buildable with `dotnet build`. Unity projects and other Full Framework projects are not supported.

To use the .NET 6 build, set `omnisharp.useModernNet` to `true` in your VS Code settings and restart OmniSharp.

## Note about using .NET Core 3.1.4xx SDKs

The .NET 3.1.4xx SDKs require version 16.7 of MSBuild.

For MacOS and Linux users who have Mono installed, this means you will need to set `omnisharp.useGlobalMono` to `never` until a version of Mono ships with MSBuild 16.7.

You can also use the .NET 6 build of OmniSharp which runs on the .NET 6 SDK. See instructions above.

## Note about using .NET 5 SDKs

The .NET 5 SDK requires version 16.8 of MSBuild.

For Windows users who have Visual Studio installed, this means you will need to be on the latest Visual Studio 16.8 Preview.

For MacOS and Linux users who have Mono installed, this means you will need to set `omnisharp.useGlobalMono` to `never` until a version of Mono ships with MSBuild 16.8.

You can also use the .NET 6 build of OmniSharp which runs on the .NET 6 SDK. See instructions above.

## Note about using .NET 6 SDKs

The .NET 6 SDK requires version 16.10 of MSBuild.

For Windows users who have Visual Studio installed, this means you will need to have Visual Studio 16.11 or newer installed.

For MacOS and Linux users who have Mono installed, this means you will need to set `omnisharp.useGlobalMono` to `never` until a version of Mono ships with MSBuild 16.10.

You can also use the .NET 6 build of OmniSharp which runs on the .NET 6 SDK. See instructions above.

### Emmet support in Razor files

To enable emmet support, add the following to your settings.json:

```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "aspnetcorerazor": "html"
}
```

### Semantic Highlighting

The C# semantic highlighting support is in preview. To enable, set `editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled` and `csharp.semanticHighlighting.enabled` to `true` in your settings. Semantic highlighting is only provided for code files that are part of the active project.

To really see the difference, try the new Visual Studio 2019 Light and Dark themes with semantic colors that closely match Visual Studio 2019.

### Supported Operating Systems for Debugging

Currently, the C# debugger officially supports the following operating systems:

* X64 operating systems:
    * Windows 7 SP1 and newer
    * macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and newer
    * Linux: see [.NET Core documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2-supported-os.md#linux) for the list of supported distributions. Note that other Linux distributions will likely work as well as long as they include glibc and OpenSSL.
* ARM operating systems:
    * Linux is supported as a remote debugging target

### Found a Bug?
